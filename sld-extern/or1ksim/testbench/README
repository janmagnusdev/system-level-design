			      Or1ksim Test Suite
			      ==================


This directory includes some test case programs that should be used to verify
correct operation of the or1ksim, OR32 GCC and OR32 GNU Binutils.


Pre-requisites
==============

The GNU toolchain for OpenRISC 1000 is required. Instructions how to build
these GNU tools can be found on www.opencores.org

Or1ksim must be built and installed (see ../README)


Configuration and Running
=========================

The installation uses standard GNU autoconf/automake files. Generic
instructions on this are in the INSTALL file.

Or1ksim Test Suite should be capable of being built in a separate directory -
but for now that is broken.

All programs are built and checked from the test directory by:

  $ ./configure --target=or32-uclinux --host=or32
  $ make all
  $ make check


!!! For all test cases, or1ksim should be built with ONLY_VIRTUAL_MACHINE  !!!
!!! undefined in cpu/or1k/except.h. This is the default behavior           !!!

All tests should exit with:

  MTSPR(0x1234, deaddead);
  syscall exit(0)

If the test fails, it should print as much output as possible about the
failure. Overall the test script checks for the above two lines, and can be
fooled by intervening log output.


The Tests
=========

A total of 20 tests including:

dhry:     Dhrystone 2.1: a benchmark modified to use simulator's timing
	  facility.
basic:    a test for all instructions and all GPRs.
test1:    a test for "all" instructions and their combinations.
pic:      a test for PIC and TICK timer. All three modes of TICK timer are
          tested and interrupt is enabled and disabled in PIC.
excpt:    a test of l.sys instruction. Checks all the delay slot issues ind
          other things.
cfg:      a test of SPRs (SPR_VR, SPR_CPUCFGR, SPR_DMMUCFGR, SPR_IMMUCFGR,
          SPR_DCCFGR, SPR_ICCFGR, SPR_DCFGR, SPR_PCCFGR).
dma:      a test of DMA in normal (software) mode.
compress: UNIX compressed modified not to use libc calls.
mul:      Test l.mul, l.mac and l.macrc instructions.
