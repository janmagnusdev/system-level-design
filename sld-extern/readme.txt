You need a working C++ compiler (gcc >= 4, clang >= 3), OpenGL development
files, cmake, and the "make" utility. Unless you are running really ancient
software, any default C++ development environment will work.

For Debian/Ubuntu: 
    sudo apt install build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev cmake libxxf86vm-dev

Put all archives (sld-extern, assignments, solutions) in the same directory
and extract them.  Change into sld-extern and run "make".  Assignment/solution
Makefiles will then pick up the dependencies automatically.

NOTE: Make sure to have no whitespace in the path to your directory!

If you are not familiar with vi or vim feel free to install an editor of your choice.
 - gedit (requires X server)
 - Joe
 - Emacs
 - Notepad++
