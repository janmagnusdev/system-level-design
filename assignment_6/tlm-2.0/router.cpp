// FILLME: implement router::b_transport
//   NOTE: You can use 'targets.decode()' from the address_map class for
//         the actual decoding.  'address_map::npos' is returned, if the
//         requested address is not mapped.
//         Keep in mind to translate the address to the target address space
//         and reset it before return.

// FILLME: implement router::end_of_elaboration
//         setup the targets from the memory map file
//         (as in the bus implementation)
